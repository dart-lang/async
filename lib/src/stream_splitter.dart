/// consume a lot of memory. The user can call [close] to indicate that no more
/// branches will be created, and this memory will be released.

/// to*. It's paused when all branches are paused *or when all branches are
/// canceled*, and resumed once there's at least one branch that's listening and
/// unpaused. It's not canceled unless no branches are listening and [close] has
