/// An asynchronous pull-based interface for accessing stream events.
///
/// Wraps a stream and makes individual events available on request.
///
/// You can request (and reserve) one or more events from the stream,
/// and after all previous requests have been fulfilled, stream events
/// go towards fulfilling your request.
///
/// For example, if you ask for [next] two times, the returned futures
/// will be completed by the next two unrequested events from the stream.
///
/// The stream subscription is paused when there are no active
/// requests.
///
/// Some streams, including broadcast streams, will buffer
/// events while paused, so waiting too long between requests may
/// cause memory bloat somewhere else.
///
/// This is similar to, but more convenient than, a [StreamIterator].
/// A `StreamIterator` requires you to manually check when a new event is
/// available and you can only access the value of that event until you
/// check for the next one. A `StreamQueue` allows you to request, for example,
/// three events at a time, either individually, as a group using [take]
/// or [skip], or in any combination.
///
/// You can also ask to have the [rest] of the stream provided as
/// a new stream. This allows, for example, taking the first event
/// out of a stream and continuing to use the rest of the stream as a stream.
///
/// Example:
///
///     var events = new StreamQueue<String>(someStreamOfLines);
///     var first = await events.next;
///     while (first.startsWith('#')) {
///       // Skip comments.
///       first = await events.next;
///     }
///
///     if (first.startsWith(MAGIC_MARKER)) {
///       var headerCount =
///           first.parseInt(first.substring(MAGIC_MARKER.length + 1));
///       handleMessage(headers: await events.take(headerCount),
///                     body: events.rest);
///       return;
///     }
///     // Error handling.
///
/// When you need no further events the `StreamQueue` should be closed
/// using [cancel]. This releases the underlying stream subscription.
abstract class StreamQueue<T> {
  // This class maintains two queues: one of events and one of requests.
  // The active request (the one in front of the queue) is called with
  // the current event queue when it becomes active, every time a
  // new event arrives, and when the event source closes.
  //
  // If the request returns `true`, it's complete and will be removed from the
  // request queue.
  // If the request returns `false`, it needs more events, and will be called
  // again when new events are available. It may trigger a call itself by
  // calling [_updateRequests].
  // The request can remove events that it uses, or keep them in the event
  // queue until it has all that it needs.
  //
